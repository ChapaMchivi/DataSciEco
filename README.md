Hereâ€™s a condensed version of your instructions:
In this final assignment, I created a Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda environment), insert code and markdown cells, and share your notebook through GitHub.
Take screenshots throughout the lab and save them as .jpg or .png files to upload for peer review.
The exercises involve creating and titling a notebook, adding markdown cells for introductions and lists, creating tables and arithmetic expression examples, writing code cells for operations, and listing objectives and author details.
Finally, save and download the notebook, upload it to a public GitHub repository, and take a screenshot of the first page
